'''. Commit 2: Add an extra Python file that creates two instances of the UserInputValidator class. This
file should also contain a separate file named extra.txt, which includes the mathematical constant
π to the 12th digit. This extra.txt file should be ignored for all staging and committing to the online
repository (see instructions below)'''
